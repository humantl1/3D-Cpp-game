Weekly Summaries

Week 1 : Project Setup
- Switch to SDL
  - Implement SDL in Linux to understand command line commands
    - libsdl2-dev : main SDL library
    - libsdl2-image-dev : image display library
    - libsdl2-ttf-dev : true type font library
    - libsdl2-mixer-dev : sound library
    - liblua5.3-dev : LUA, for scripting language (5.3 for max compatibility)
  - Setup Linux virtual machine for testing game and libraries manually (outside of IDE)
  - Research Make for use manually compiling in Linux
    - Create Make file to manually include directories, clean executable, and output named executable
  - Research git forking to fork a branch of current game to transition from GLFW to SDL
    - Setup alternate branch for SDL integration
  - Including SDL and Lua took a lot of internet troubleshooting to successfully incorporate
    - Simultaneously developing in Linux and Windows illuminated the contrast between
      development differences between the two. Linux took minutes to implement, Windows took half a day.
