Week 3 : Game Loop Implementation
- Move core functionality to discreet classes
  -  Input
  -  SDL_window
  -  Update
- Fix time step in 3D game code
  - Implement cpu independent Delta Time
  - Decouple desired frames per second from functionality via a separate "constant" class
  - Sync rendering buffer output with Delta Time
- Begin more robust SDL input implementation, replacing ad hoc GLFW input functionality
  - Begin attempt to abstract input functionality from specific input implementation
    - i.e. classes that receive input are uneffected by changes in input implementation
    - This will require significant engineering, as an event system would be the most robust
        way to achieve this
- Begin researching potential event system architectures
